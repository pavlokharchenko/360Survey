# 360Survey

##### What is 360 Degree Feedback? 
360 Degree Feedback is a system or process in which employees receive confidential, anonymous feedback from the people who work around them. This typically includes the employee's manager, peers, and direct reports. A mixture of about eight to twelve people fill out an anonymous online feedback form that asks questions covering a broad range of workplace competencies. The feedback forms include questions that are measured on a rating scale and also ask raters to provide written comments. The person receiving feedback also fills out a self-rating survey that includes the same survey questions that others receive in their forms.

Managers and leaders within organizations use 360 feedback surveys to get a better understanding of their strengths and weaknesses. The 360 feedback system automatically tabulates the results and presents them in a format that helps the feedback recipient create a development plan. Individual responses are always combined with responses from other people in the same rater category (e.g. peer, direct report) in order to preserve anonymity and to give the employee a clear picture of his/her greatest overall strengths and weaknesses.

360 Feedback can also be a useful development tool for people who are not in a management role. Strictly speaking, a "non-manager" 360 assessment is not measuring feedback from 360 degrees since there are no direct reports, but the same principles still apply. 360 Feedback for non-managers is useful to help people be more effective in their current roles, and also to help them understand what areas they should focus on if they want to move into a management role.

##### How is 360 Degree Feedback Used? 
Companies typically use a 360 feedback system in one of two ways:

###### 1. 360 Feedback as a Development Tool to help employees recognize strengths and weaknesses and become more effective

When done properly, 360 is highly effective as a development tool. The feedback process gives people an opportunity to provide anonymous feedback to a coworker that they might otherwise be uncomfortable giving. Feedback recipients gain insight into how others perceive them and have an opportunity to adjust behaviors and develop skills that will enable them to excel at their jobs.

###### 2. 360 Feedback as a Performance Appraisal Tool to measure employee performance

Using a 360 degree feedback system for Performance Appraisal is a common practice, but not always a good idea. It is difficult to properly structure a 360 feedback process that creates an atmosphere of trust when you use 360 evaluations to measure performance. Moreover, 360 feedback focuses on behaviors and competencies more than on basic skills, job requirements, and performance objectives. These things are most appropriately addressed by an employee and his/her manager as part of an annual review and performance appraisal process. It is certainly possible and can be beneficial to incorporate 360 feedback into a larger performance management process, but only with clear communication on how the 360 feedback will be used.

##### What a 360 Feedback Survey Measures:
 - 360 feedback measures behaviors and competencies
 - 360 assessments provide feedback on how others perceive an employee
 - 360 feedback addresses skills such as listening, planning, and goal-setting
 - A 360 evaluation focuses on subjective areas such as teamwork, character, and leadership effectiveness

##### What 360 Feedback Surveys do not assess:
 - 360 feedback is not a way to measure employee performance objectives (MBOs)
 - 360 feedback is not a way to determine whether an employee is meeting basic job requirements
 - 360 feedback is not focused on basic technical or job-specific skills
 - 360 feedback should not be used to measure strictly objective things such as attendance, sales quotas, etc.
